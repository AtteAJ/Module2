<h1>Farewell to a friend</h1>
<p><strong>This is a poem written by Li Bai (701-762 AC.)</strong> It is a farewell poem full of poetic and picturesque flavor. 
<br>The poet and his friends ride horses to bid farewell, full of affection and touching.</p>
<br>
<p><b><em>Green hills that rise beyond the walls,<br>
A guardian moat that eastward calls.<br>
We bid farewell, you’ll journey on,<br>
Like a dandelion, a path unknown.</p><br>

<p>The sky’s white clouds that drift and dream, <br>
Like your wanderings, forever out of reach. <br>
The setting sun, unwilling to leave, <br>
Mirrors my longing, my love’s reprieve.</p><br>

<p>Wavegoodbye, each on our own way, <br>
The horse that bore my friend, neighs astray. <br>
Unwilling to depart, its whinnies raise <br>
My sorrow, amplifying my dismay.</em></b></p>
<br>
<p>The first couplet, “Green mountains across the north, and white water around the east city”, explained the farewell location, <br>
The poet has already sent his friend out of the city, but the two are still bridle side by side, unwilling to separate. <br>
In the distance, green mountains stretch across the north of the outer city, sparkling water flows around the east of the city. <br>
<br>These two sentences, “Qingshan” is against “Baishui”, and “Beiguo” is against “Dongcheng”. <br>
The first couplet is written as a beautiful couplet, which is unique; <br>
The word “horizontal” outlines the quiet posture of the green hills,<br>
and the word “around” depicts the dynamics of the white water. The words are accurate and vivid.<br>
Poetic pen is swaying freely, depicting a beautiful and beautiful picture. I didn’t see the word “farewell”, <br>
but when I tasted it carefully, the pen was clearly full of reluctance to say goodbye.</p>
