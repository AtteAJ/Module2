        <h1>Farewell to a Friend</h1>
        <p><strong>This is a poem written by Li Bai (701-762 AD.)</strong> It is a farewell poem full of poetic and picturesque flavor. 
        <br>The poet and his friends ride horses to bid farewell, full of affection and touching.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b><em>Green hills that rise beyond the walls,<br>
        A guardian moat that eastward calls.<br>
        We bid farewell, you’ll journey on,<br>
        Like a dandelion, a path unknown.</em></b></p>

    <p><b><em>The sky’s white clouds that drift and dream, <br>
    Like your wanderings, forever out of reach. <br>
    The setting sun, unwilling to leave, <br>
    Mirrors my longing, my love’s reprieve.</em></b></p><br>

    <p><em><b>Wavegoodbye, each on our own way, <br>
    The horse that bore my friend, neighs astray. <br>
    Unwilling to depart, its whinnies raise <br>
    My sorrow, amplifying my dismay.</b></em></p>
<br>
<p>The first couplet, “Green mountains across the north, and white water around the east city,” explained the farewell location. <br>
    The poet has already sent his friend out of the city, but the two are still bridle side by side, unwilling to separate. <br>
    In the distance, green mountains stretch across the north of the outer city, sparkling water flows around the east of the city. <br>
    These two sentences, “Qingshan” is against “Baishui”, and “Beiguo” is against “Dongcheng”. <br>
    The first couplet is written as a beautiful couplet, which is unique; <br>
    The word “horizontal” outlines the quiet posture of the green hills, and the word “around” depicts the dynamics of the white water. The words are accurate and vivid. <br>
    The poetic pen is swaying freely, depicting a beautiful and beautiful picture. I didn’t see the word “farewell”, <br>
    but when I tasted it carefully, the pen was clearly full of reluctance to say goodbye.</p>
